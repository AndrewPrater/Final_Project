# Final_Project
To get started with opencv you first need to ensure that the proper libraries are installed in your anaconda environment. Since the most recent free version of opencv does not include SURF feature extraction, we will have to download an older version. To get started you should create a new environment that uses python version 3.6.13 in the anaconda navigator. Add the opencv version 3.4.2, scipy version 1.5.2, and scikit-learn version 0.24.2 libraries to the environment. Downloading these libraries should automatically install the proper numpy and matplot libraries (numpy version 1.19.2 and matplotlib version 3.3.4). To make sure your device uses this environment, you will need to activate the environment in the anaconda prompt (activate myenv). Then launch the code editor you are using from the anaconda prompt.
When running it, it is important that the working directory is the directory that the source file is located in.
The folders containing the test ant train images should not be in the same directory as the source file, but one directory higher. However the model file will be located in same directory as the source file.
